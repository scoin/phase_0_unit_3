This was actually fun. I recently did some work on a photo shoot, and I used the styling and photos as data models, thinking about something that
would help the stylist record what clothes were used in which photo.
The challenge is definitely the design and solving problems with the structure. Of course I still need to use references for syntax, but by the end I was doing it with no problems.
This cemented joining for me - I had been discussing this with a programmer friend recently and what he said really helped - basically how much more efficient it was to use SQL select and join statements rather than brute force all the data in code and make hundreds of requests.
