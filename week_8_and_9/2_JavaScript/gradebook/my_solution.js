/*U3.W8-9: Gradebook from Names and Scores

You will work with the following two variables.  The first, students, holds the names of four students.  
The second, scores, holds groups of test scores.  The relative positions of elements within the two 
variables match (i.e., 'Joseph' is the first element in students; his scores are the first value in scores.).

Do not alter the students and scores code.

I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]

var students = ["Joseph", "Susan", "William", "Elizabeth"]

var scores = [ [80, 70, 70, 100],
               [85, 80, 90, 90],
               [75, 70, 80, 75],
               [100, 90, 95, 85] ]

// Write your code below.

var average = function(scores){
	sum = 0;
	for(var i = 0; i < scores.length; i++){
		sum += scores[i];
	}
	return sum / scores.length;
}

var gradebook = {
	Joseph : {testScores : scores[0]},
	Susan : {testScores : scores[1]},
	William : {testScores : scores[2]},
	Elizabeth : {testScores : scores[3]},
	addScore : function(name, grade){
		this[name].testScores.push(grade);
	},
	getAverage : function(name){
		return average(this[name].testScores);
	}
}

//Wow, my javascript knowledge had atrophied quickly. I had to go through
//all my code from 5 weeks ago, and still do a w3schools lookup. This simple
//task took me over an over. BUT, this was really rewarding. My js is back
//and it feels great. The syntax of objects was the main issue.
//Seeing assert written in JS was also helpful.
